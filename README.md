# HohesC Lite Console
HohesC Lite Console aka OSCtesttool, is a work in progress project for a OSC sender and receiver to easily test and debug programms and or hardware that use OSC.
Since it is a wip it so far only has a send function, which is also limited to single manually typed messages.

A receive function has been added though it is somewhat buggy so far since it won't receive on a seperate port from the one the program sends on.
Further I'll plan to integrate loading profiles and sending of pre made lists.

## Download
The last compiled release DOES NOT contain the receive function yet!
For the compiled pre release please visit the [releases ](https://github.com/BuoyantToaster/HohesC-Lite-Console/releases/tag/v0.0.1)tab.
