# HohesC Lite Console
HohesC Lite Console aka OSCtesttool, is a work in progress project for a console application that is able to send and receive messages via Open
Sound Control (OSC). 
Since it is a wip a lot of changes will happen to it in the future.

## Code notes
A receive function has been added though it is somewhat buggy so far since the receive port has to be entered twice for the receiver to actually
use it.

## Future plans for the code
I plan to integrate loading profiles and sending of pre made lists. (mostlikely in the csv format).
Additionally I want to create a better Version of the software that uses a GUI.

## Download
The last compiled release DOES NOT contain the receive function yet!
For the compiled pre release please visit the [releases ](https://github.com/BuoyantToaster/HohesC-Lite-Console/releases/tag/v0.0.1)tab.
