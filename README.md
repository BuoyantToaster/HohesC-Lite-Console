# HohesC Lite Console
HohesC Lite Console aka OSCtesttool, is a work in progress project for a OSC sender and receiver to easily test and debug programms and or hardware that use OSC.
Since it is a wip it so far only has a send function, which is also limited to single manually typed messages.

Plans for the future are to add a receiver function, preferrably one that runs in a second window so it can be used simultaniously with sending.
Further I'll plan to integrate loading profiles and sending of pre made lists.
